# Diabetes-Prediction

### Link to the dataset: [Mendeley Data](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/d5dtz46xcz/1)


## Overview:
This project aims to predict diabetes using machine learning techniques. It includes a Jupyter Notebook for training and evaluating a model and a dataset containing relevant medical features.

## Files in This Repository:
Diabetes-Prediction-Notebook.ipynb: A Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

Diabetes.csv: The dataset used for training and testing the model.

## Dataset Details
The dataset contains medical features such as glucose levels, BMI, and blood pressure, which are used to predict whether a person has diabetes or not.

## Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:
-Clone this repository: 
```
git clone <repository-url> -cd <repository-folder>
```
-Install dependencies: 
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
-Open the Jupyter Notebook: 
```
jupyter notebook
```
-Then, open Diabetes-Prediction-Notebook.ipynb and run the cells.

-Run the notebook to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate performance.

## Some Future Improvements we would like to do

-Implement more advanced models such as deep learning.

-Add hyperparameter tuning.

-Deploy the model as a web application.
